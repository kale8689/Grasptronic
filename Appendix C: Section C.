// Example code for Force Limitation:
// stepper_motor_decrease would be a function that directs the stepper motor to open the needle driver jaws. This function has pseduo-code of possible functionality. 
if (force > x){
// when force is outside tissue/suture/mesh threshold of 1.5 - 2.5 N
// when force is outside metal needles threshold of 3.46 - 4.46 N
